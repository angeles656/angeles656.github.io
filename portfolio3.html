        <p>I happen to be in Tondo, on the grounds of the church where the old deity, the santo niño is enshrined. 
            It was knocked down during the hyper-capitalist epoch many generations ago in favour of building an engorged SM hyper-mall. 
            After the first google war a Pan-Philippine anarchic civilisation, acting as a rhizomatic network of equal operatives emerged.
            A de-centralised system where the inter-peoples -—- inter-island functions cooperate symbiotically, 
            emerging from the post Jejemon coup led by ‘LiL' ZupLadO’ and the ruin of the Philippine hyper-capitalist state. 
            Lost indigenous and marginalised cultures regained individual sovereignty of land and autonomy. 
            Immortalised by the descendents of the land he left behind, many chroniclers across the breadth of time and across the archipelago have likened LiL' ZupLadO to Tudbulul, 
            to kabunian, to Bathala and to Rizal, deifying him, syncretising a new pan-Philippine cultural memory to that of old.
             Remnants live on in the psyche of the Philippine to this day. 
            </p>

        <p>Since the end of the hyper-capitalist epoch, the SM hyper-mall located in Tondo, a hulking network of translucent glass and stainless steel four stories tall, 
            has been reclaimed by the locals. A huge rusty red sign covering the old SM sign, intelligible from a distance signifies the entrance with the words:
            </p>
    
        <p>.</p>
        <p>.</p>
        <p>Transients welcome</p>
        <p>.</p>
        <p>.</p>


        <p>The club is located in the decaying carpark of the hypermall. Just for tonight. Towed in by a modded truck, a touring bayanihan has bunkered down for the night, 
            a giant of a vehicle equivalent to the width and diameter of six jeepneys and plastered with the bodywork and iconic airbrushed motifs to match.
            Rizal, CP3, ZupLadO’, and other enshrined deities cover the exterior of the club, which is fused to the undercarriage of a monster truck, bumping around on its suspension with the rhythm of the club dwellers inside. 
            It appears like a beacon in the darkness, multicoloured light escapes from the windows, lasering out to the sky and refracting off the glass panes of the mall behind it. 
            The resulting multi spectra lightshow lands onto the sea of mopeds, bikes and people scattered in a circle around the mobile club, appearing like a car meet. 
            I’m still a considerable distance away. Music dissipates through the air, the metallic walls of the club strip the mid and high frequencies, leaving only the rumble of the bass to arrive, 
            washing over my ears and vibrating through my body. Moving closer. Walking through the maze of assorted bikes, conversations and voices emerge and descend, contending with each other through the serene bass rumble. 
            Tagalog, English, Taglish, Bicol, Ilocano, Cebuano, Kankana-ey, Swardpeak, an offline codification of Jejenese. Rising and falling over and over as I sidestep past the swathes of people.
            I reach the entrance. A metallic stairway made of tread plate glimmering with the variegated lightshow dissipating from the entrance,
             spilling out onto it, everywhere, one story up in the air above the monster truck wheels, beginning the ascent up to the entrance.
            </p>

        <p>Reaching the top of the staircase I walk through the doorway. A massive expanse of a room and a sea of people meet me. More blustery than the crowd outside, not rough, just gently rolling with the sound. 
            Pushing and pulling with his gravity, that of Libulan. A certain saccharine shine pervades the space, as if multicoloured lasers are fired at millions of disco balls tinted with the rio de janeiro filter, 
            bombarding every orifice and every sensory organ of the body, dazzling off the walls and imbuing the music emanating throughout the space with the same corporeal glint. 
            A whirlpool of people forms, circling the central point of the room. A celebration for LiL’ ZupLadO… e$tleelaR3 6i3ailaR3eL, the resident DJ of this particular bayanihan is performing tonight. 
            She was pushed out from her home, a body of water devouring some of her family. She’s now living a nomadic lifestyle travelling island-island, city-city, in search of her wings.
            My ears are held by the sparkling embrace of the music, recalling a nostalgia for a time memorably inmemorable. A hybrid between pre-decentralisation hyper-ballad style chords and vocals, phantasmagoric in nature, 
            layered over samples of electroacoustic neo-gangsa/solibao Takik ensemble rhythms. Bungkakas twang and shapeshift iridescently from ear to ear. Gagong Rapper fantasia. Purely improvisation, 
            the whirlpool of collective consciousness possesses her, envelopes us, channelling through her blood, she circles round her body. Samples of Hambog ng Sagpro’s ‘facebook’ are interwoven with our voice, Rizal’s kundiman. 
            Playing off each other, question and answer. Ugnayan. Radio stations from different temporal dimensions converging into one point.

            <p>.</p>
            <p>.</p>

        <p>emergence</p>

        <p>.</p>
        <p>.</p>

        <p>She sings into a karaoke mic, every sound, every word, every expletive uttered lasers out beams of light, bouncing off the walls before settling as hazy white holograms, the faces and bodies of the ex-global diaspora, 
            lost during the 1st google war, now visible. The apparitions move and fuse with one another led by the gyrating of their fingertips, momentarily joining the whirlpool around the centre of the room before flaming out, 
            transmuting into camote vines, quickly, burning away into invisibility. As the snake of the time-continuum bends and eats its tail, in that moment, the fusion of Philippine utterances, 
            human, inhuman, past present and future are processed and congealed, the individual sonic organs, vessels, sinew and tissue of Pan-Philippine sounding ground together, digested, 
            rebirthed into a new form analogous to the original frequency spectra, but of different shape. An instrument of Philippine audibility assumed in a manifestation wholly different.
